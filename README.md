# Solar System Simulation

A 3D interactive solar system simulation built with **Three.js**.

## Concept
- Explore planets in a 3D solar system.
- Click planets for detailed information.
- Adjust simulation speed and reset the view.
- Planet sizes with correct ratios but the location of the planets themselves are not correct

## Technologies
- **Three.js**: For 3D rendering.
- **Vite**: For development and bundling.

## Persisting Issues
- Sometimes when not preciesly clicking on a planet the Information-Box will say undefined
